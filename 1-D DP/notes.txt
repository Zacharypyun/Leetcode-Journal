Dynamic programming is Recustion + Memorization.
    It's main purpouse (use on problems where...) you want to break up a problem into smaller parts (like recusrion) but there is alot of overlap so you don't want to compute the same things over and over again

For most basic and intermediate problems you should be able to get by using arrays and hashmaps to store a cache of complete problems (can be re used with a O(1) lookup time)
