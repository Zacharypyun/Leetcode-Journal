When to use BFS vs DFS

    BFS is generaly used when the problem talks about levels, distance, or shortest path.
        BFS spreads out evenly so it better for shallow solutions
    
    DFS is generaly used when you need to expore all possible paths, need to backtrack, 
    accumulate stateor divide and conquer
        DFS is exaustive and checks all nodes

Pseudo Code

    BFS should be done using a queue or stack to track what has been seen and to insert child
    nodes into

    DFS should be done recursivly, calling the function on each child insures that 
    everything is searched
