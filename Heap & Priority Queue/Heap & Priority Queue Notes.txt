heapq.heapify(list) // turns a list into a prioirty queue (basic definition is a min heap)

heapq.heapop(list) //pops the first element while maintaining a heap structure
			//you can also pop normaly on the data but it would ruin the heap structure so only use .heappop

heapq.heappush(list, element) //pushes element into the list and mantains the heaps structure

heapq._heapify_max(data) //max heap

something = heapq.merge(list1, list2) //returns a min heap with all values from both lists
