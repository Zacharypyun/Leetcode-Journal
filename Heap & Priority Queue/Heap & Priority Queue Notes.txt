import heapq

heapq.heapify(list) // turns a list into a prioirty queue (basic definition is a min heap)

heapq.heapop(list) //pops the first element while maintaining a heap structure
			//you can also pop normaly on the data but it would ruin the heap structure so only use .heappop

heapq.heappush(list, element) //pushes element into the list and mantains the heaps structure

Max heap: do a regular min heap but insert all the numbers as negatives
	max_heap = []
	for num in nums:
		max_heap.append(num)
	heapq.heapify(max_heap)

something = heapq.merge(list1, list2) //returns a min heap with all values from both lists

if you push a tuple (variable1, variable2) it sorts by the first element
