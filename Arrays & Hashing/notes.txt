Look for problems about:
    Finding duplicates, frequency counts, or quick lookups.
    Checking for presence of elements.
    Counting occurrences, grouping, or mapping values.
    Hashing is often used for O(1) average-time lookup.
Example problem types:
    Two sum, anagrams, longest substring without repeating characters, etc.
