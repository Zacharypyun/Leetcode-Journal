Use when:
    The problem involves a sorted array or range.
    You want to find a target or boundary (e.g., smallest/largest element meeting a condition).
    You want to search in logarithmic time.
Classic clues:
    “Find element in sorted array”
    “Find minimum/maximum value under constraints”
    “Search in rotated sorted array”
