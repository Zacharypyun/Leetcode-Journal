Most common graph algorithms 
    1. DFS:
        • Done recursivly 
        • O(n)
        • Data structures needed: hashset
        • Done the same as tree DFS but you store visited nodes to prevent cycles
    2. BFS:
        • Done using a queue
        • O(n)
        • Data structures needed: queue, hashset
        • Also the same as tree BFS but using a hashset to ctore visited nodes
    3. Dijkstras:
        • Picks the shortest path each time 
        • O(Elog(V))
        • Data structures needed: pq/heap, hashset
        • Pick the shortest path to each node (track current length), store seen nodes in hashset
    4. Union Find
        • learn how to do
        • O(nlog(n))
        • Data structures needed: forest of trees
        •    
    5. Topological Sort:
        • relearn
        • O(n)
        • Data structures needed: hashset
        • Done using DFS
