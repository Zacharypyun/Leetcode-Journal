Use when:
    The problem asks for something like longest/shortest substring or subarray with certain properties.
    You need to process contiguous segments efficiently.
    Constraints hint at linear time solutions on sequences.
Typical patterns:
    Fixed-size window (e.g., max in window size k).
    Variable-size window expanding/shrinking to meet conditions.
